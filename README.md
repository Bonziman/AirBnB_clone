## Introduction
Welcome to the AirBnB clone project. This repository holds the first step towards building a full web application clone of AirBnB. The primary focus of this stage is the development of a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects.

### Key Features:
- Implementation of a parent class, `BaseModel`, for initialization, serialization, and deserialization of future instances.
- A simple flow for serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file.
- Creation of AirBnB classes (User, State, City, Place, etc.) inheriting from `BaseModel`.
- Development of the first abstracted storage engine: File storage.
- Comprehensive unittests for validating classes and storage engine.

## Installation
To set up the project environment:

1. Clone the repository: 
   ```bash
   git clone [repository link]
